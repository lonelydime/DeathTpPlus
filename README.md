DeathTpPlus
===========

DeathTpPlus announces a death with a random message based on the death cause and allows you to teleport to the point of death.
It can also create a TombStone at the place were you died to let you save your inventory (aka DeadMansChest).
You can also create a tomb sign which can be used as respawn point and as a place of information of how often you died
and what your last death cause was.
